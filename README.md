# chessdashboard

Cloud-native analytics pipeline for chess games from Lichess and Chess.com. Fetches games via public APIs, loads raw data into [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/) (cloud DuckDB), transforms with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), and visualizes in a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard.

**Live dashboard:** [rbrtrss-chessdashboard.streamlit.app](https://rbrtrss-chessdashboard.streamlit.app/)

```

The pipeline has three decoupled layers that communicate through MotherDuck schemas:

| Layer | Directory | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Extract & Load** | `ingestion/` | Fetch games from Lichess (NDJSON) and Chess.com (PGN archives), parse into a common schema, load into MotherDuck `raw.games` |
| **Transform** | `transform/` | dbt project: staging model deduplicates and normalizes, mart models compute daily results, opening stats by color, and a central fact table |
| **Visualize** | `dashboard/` | Streamlit app reading directly from MotherDuck `analytics` schema |

Orchestration runs on GitHub Actions: a daily cron triggers ingestion followed by `dbt build`, and a CI workflow runs lint + tests on every PR.

```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
- A [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/) account (free tier works)

## Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbrtrss/chessdashboard.git
cd chessdashboard
uv sync
```

2. **Configure environment variables**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```
MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN=your_motherduck_token
LICHESS_USERNAME=your_lichess_username
CHESSCOM_USERNAME=your_chesscom_username
DESTINATION=motherduck
```

3. **Create the MotherDuck database**

```bash
make setup
```

## Usage

### Local development

A `Makefile` wraps common commands so local and CI stay in sync:

```bash
# Fetch games from both platforms and load into MotherDuck
make ingest

# Run dbt: staging → marts → tests
make transform

# Launch Streamlit dashboard
make dash
```

### Ingestion CLI

```bash
# Fetch from both platforms (uses .env usernames)
uv run python -m ingestion.pipeline

# Fetch from one platform only
uv run python -m ingestion.pipeline --platform lichess

# Limit number of games fetched
uv run python -m ingestion.pipeline --platform chesscom --max 100
```

The ingestion layer is **idempotent**: games are deduplicated on `game_id` via `write_disposition="merge"` — re-running is always safe. dlt stores incremental state at the destination so only new games are pulled on each run.

### dbt

```bash
cd transform

# Run all models
uv run dbt run

# Run tests
uv run dbt test

# Build (run + test) and generate docs
uv run dbt build
uv run dbt docs generate && uv run dbt docs serve
```

### Dashboard

```bash
uv run streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

The dashboard connects to MotherDuck using the `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` environment variable loaded from `.env`.

## Data model

### Staging

**`stg_games`** — One row per game, with time control parsing and player perspective derived from `LICHESS_USERNAME` / `CHESSCOM_USERNAME` env vars:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `game_id` | `VARCHAR` | Unique identifier (source-prefixed) |
| `source` | `VARCHAR` | `lichess` or `chesscom` |
| `played_at` | `TIMESTAMP` | Game start time (UTC) |
| `white_username` | `VARCHAR` | White player's username |
| `black_username` | `VARCHAR` | Black player's username |
| `white_rating` | `INTEGER` | White player's Elo at game time |
| `black_rating` | `INTEGER` | Black player's Elo at game time |
| `result` | `VARCHAR` | Raw game result |
| `eco` | `VARCHAR` | ECO opening code |
| `time_control` | `VARCHAR` | Raw time control string |
| `moves` | `VARCHAR` | Move list |
| `my_color` | `VARCHAR` | `white` or `black` (which side I played) |
| `time_category` | `VARCHAR` | `bullet`, `blitz`, `rapid`, or `classical` |
| `my_result` | `VARCHAR` | `win`, `loss`, or `draw` |
| `my_rating` | `INTEGER` | My Elo at game time |
| `opponent_rating` | `INTEGER` | Opponent Elo at game time |

### Marts

- **`fct_games`** — Central fact table joining `stg_games` with `eco_codes` seed for opening names, variants, player rating, and opponent strength classification
- **`daily_results`** — Daily game counts grouped by result, source, and time category; drives the results-over-time chart
- **`opening_stats`** — Opening performance by ECO code, color, source, and date: games played, wins, losses, draws, and win rate; drives the opening donut charts

## CI/CD

### Daily pipeline (`.github/workflows/daily_pipeline.yml`)

Runs on cron at 06:00 UTC:

1. Install dependencies with `uv sync`
2. Run ingestion (`make ingest`)
3. Run `dbt build` (models + tests)
4. Fail the workflow if any dbt test fails

### CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Runs on every push to `main`:

1. Lint with `ruff`
2. Run `pytest` for ingestion unit tests
3. Run dbt unit tests (`dbt test --select test_type:unit --target ci`) against a local DuckDB

## Deployment

### Dashboard on Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Push the repo to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) → **New app**
3. Set the main file path to `dashboard/app.py`
4. Under **Advanced settings → Secrets**, add:

```toml
MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN = "your_motherduck_token"
LICHESS_USERNAME = "your_lichess_username"
CHESSCOM_USERNAME = "your_chesscom_username"
```

### GitHub Actions secrets

Add these repository secrets for the CI/CD workflows:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` | MotherDuck API token |
| `LICHESS_USERNAME` | Lichess username for ingestion |
| `CHESSCOM_USERNAME` | Chess.com username for ingestion |

## Stack

| Component | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Warehouse | MotherDuck | Serverless cloud DuckDB — zero infra, SQL-native, generous free tier |
| Transform | dbt-duckdb | Industry-standard transform layer with testing, docs, and lineage |
| Dashboard | Streamlit | Python-native, fast to build, free cloud hosting |
| Orchestration | GitHub Actions | Already in the repo, no extra service to manage |
| Dependencies | uv | Fast, reproducible Python dependency management |
| CI | ruff + pytest + dbt test | Lint, unit tests, and data quality in one pipeline |
